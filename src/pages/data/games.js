    description: 'A haunting metroid-vania that plunges you into the shattered remnants of a world torn apart by a cataclysmic echo. You play as a lone wanderer armed with an ancient resonance gauntlet, capable of reshaping the very terrain with sonic pulses. Delve through moss-cloaked ruins and bioluminescent caverns, unlocking echo-powered abilities—like phasing through walls, shattering barriers, and rewinding time itself. Face off against corrupted guardians born of sound and shadow, piece together the forgotten lore of your civilization, and decide whether to harness the echo to restore balance—or let it consume everything in its path.',
